# Marathon-results-2009-2019
Analysis of the results of the Rotterdam Marathon from 2009 to 2019.

I have run this marathon myself 4 times (2014, 2017, 2018 and 2019). I wanted to see what has changed in all the years. 

This is a first draft for the scraping and analysis of the Rotterdam Marathon results.

Data is scraped from two sources uitslagen.nl (available until 2017) and sporthives (available from 2018 onwards)
